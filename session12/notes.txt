- What is Thymeleaf?
	Thymeleaf is a server-side java template engine that user natural templates to generate HTML page.
- The Thymeleaf integration with Spring MVC is managed by the Thymeleaf project. 	
- Thymeleaf allows you to process six kinds of templates
	XML
	Valid XML
	XHTML
	Valid XHTML
	HTML5
	Legacy HTML5
	
	Except for the Legacy HTML5 mode, all the above modes refer to well-defined XML files. It allows us to process HTML5 files with features such as standalone tags, tag attributes without value, or not written between quotes.
	
- Thymeleaf’s core is a DOM processing engine. Specifically, it uses its own high-performance DOM implementation —not the standard DOM API— for building in-memory tree representations of your templates.

Using htmx with Spring Boot and Thymeleaf
Htmx allows building complex web applications that feel like an SPA(single-page-application) without relying on Angular or React. The client's behavior is mainly controlled by attributes within the HTML code that execute an Ajax request and integrate the result into the DOM - perfectly fitting for server-side rendering with Thymeleaf.
